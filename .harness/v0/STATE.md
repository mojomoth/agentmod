# STATE — current implementation state

Last updated: 2026-06-10 (iteration: Phase 2 — rc fenced-block editor, T08)

## Where things stand
- Phase 0 (harness) COMPLETE. Phase 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 items 1–8 LANDED
  (init + both shell hooks + rc editor done; scripted-shell integration
  tests T11 are next).
- Go skeleton LANDED and green: `go.mod` (module
  `github.com/agentmod/agentmod`, go 1.26), thin `main.go`, `internal/cli`
  dispatcher with `--version`/`version`/`help`/unknown-command handling,
  exit-code constants (0/1/2/3 per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §3).
- `internal/project` LANDED and green (T01 ✅): `Discover(startDir)` upward
  walk, nearest-wins, lexical, marker must be a regular file (D011).
- `internal/config` LANDED and green (T02 ✅): schema v1,
  `Default()`/`Parse()`/`Load()`/`Validate()`/`Marshal()`, overlay-on-defaults,
  unknown keys rejected, hard rejects per D012. BurntSushi/toml v1.6.0 is the
  ONLY dependency (D004/D009).
- `agentmod status` LANDED and green (T03 ✅): `internal/cli/status.go`.
  - `Env` struct (Getwd + LookupEnv) injected through new unexported
    `run(args, stdout, stderr, env)`; public `Run` wraps it with `osEnv()`.
    Future commands needing cwd/env should take the same `Env`.
  - Inactive (§24): "AgentMod: inactive" + not-found + global-defaults lines,
    exit 0 (inactive is an answer, not an error; exit 2 stays reserved for
    commands that REQUIRE a project).
  - Active (§24): project root, agentmod root, Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Node
    paths from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §4 layout (constants currently live in
    status.go — extract to a shared layout/routing package when init lands),
    disabled agents show `disabled (<key> = false)`, XDG opt-in annotated.
  - "Shell routing" line: reports AGENTMOD_ACTIVE truth — not applied /
    applied / applied-for-different-root (stale) via AGENTMOD_PROJECT_ROOT.
  - "Recent handoff": newest `*.amod` by mtime in `.agentmod/snapshots/`,
    else "none". Broken config → exit 1, error on stderr (Load names file).
  - 10 test funcs in status_test.go, all temp-dir/fake-Env based.
- `agentmod init` core LANDED and green (T04 ✅): `internal/cli/init.go` +
  new shared `internal/layout` package (status.go refactored onto it).
  - Always inits at cwd; nested-under-existing-project prints a shadowing
    notice and proceeds (D013). Re-init = fill missing dirs only.
  - Never overwrites: agentmod.toml (= Marshal(Default())) and the
    opencode.json stub are written via O_CREATE|O_EXCL (`writeIfAbsent`);
    pre-existing files stay byte-identical (tested). `.agentmod` as a
    regular file → error, never deleted.
  - `layout.Subdirs()` = claude codex opencode node snapshots logs (NO
    opencode/xdg — opt-in mode creates that later).
  - Currently REJECTS all arguments ("init takes no arguments yet") —
    flags (--no-shell-hook/--yes) are the T06 iteration; .gitignore editing
    (T07) and rc-hook install (T08) are separate Phase 2 items, so init
    output deliberately says nothing about them yet.
  - 6 test funcs in init_test.go (fresh, re-init no-clobber incl. stray
    user file, .agentmod-is-a-file, nested warn, re-init-at-root no warn,
    arg rejection).
- init `.gitignore` handling LANDED and green (T07 ✅): new
  `internal/cli/gitignore.go` (`ensureGitignore`), wired into runInit after
  the opencode stub; init output gained a `.gitignore:` line. Semantics in
  D014: append-with-byte-preservation; dedup accepts
  `.agentmod[/ ]`/`/.agentmod[/]` trimmed (comments/negations don't count);
  missing file created only inside a git repo (lexical upward `.git` walk,
  any file type, no exec), else "skipped (not a git repository; re-run init
  after 'git init')"; an EXISTING .gitignore is extended even outside a
  repo; `.gitignore`-as-a-directory is a hard error. 10 test funcs in
  gitignore_test.go (created/appended/newline-glue/dedup-variants/non-git
  skip/non-git-existing-file extend/ancestor repo/worktree `.git` file/
  second-run no-op/dir error). Second-run no-op already covers the
  .gitignore slice of T05.
- init idempotency LANDED and green (T05 ✅): `TestInitSecondRunIsNoOp` in
  init_test.go + `snapshotTree` helper (WalkDir → map of dir-set + full file
  bytes under cwd, incl. .agentmod and .gitignore). Runs init twice in a fake
  git repo (a bare `.git` dir satisfies insideGitRepo — no git exec),
  asserts run 2 changes/creates/removes NOTHING and its stdout reports
  all-already-present ("already initialized", "all directories already
  present", "already covers .agentmod/", 2× "already present, left
  untouched"). NO product-code change was needed — re-init was already a
  true no-op. Decision: T05 ticked ✅; its "no dup rc block" slice is folded
  into T08's matrix row (rc editor doesn't exist yet; T08 already lists
  rc-block idempotency).
- init flags LANDED and green (T06 ✅): `parseInitFlags` + `initOptions`
  struct in init.go. NOTE: the code was written by a prior iteration that got
  rate-limited mid-task before committing; this iteration verified it green,
  did the bookkeeping, and committed it.
  - Accepted: `--no-shell-hook`, `--yes`, `--non-interactive` (last two are
    synonyms → opts.NonInteractive). Unknown flag / positional arg →
    ExitError naming the offender, and init does NOT start creating anything
    (parse happens before any FS work — tested).
  - Output gained a `Shell hook:` line: "skipped (--no-shell-hook)" vs
    "not installed yet (rc-file setup lands with 'agentmod hook zsh')".
    T08's rc editor must consume `initOptions` (already threaded through
    runInit) and replace that placeholder.
  - `TestInitFlagsBuildIdenticalTree` proves every flag combo builds a
    byte-identical tree to plain init (snapshotTree reuse). No-prompt needs
    no test: runInit has no stdin parameter, so no code path can read input.
  - Honest scope: rc-skip ENFORCEMENT is T08's matrix row; auth-never-copy
    is Phase 3's. Both flags are parsed, validated, reported, and threaded
    NOW so those tasks only consume them.
- `agentmod env` LANDED and green (T09a ✅, D016): new `internal/routing`
  package (Vars(agentmodDir,cfg) in stable order, NodeBinDir, bookkeeping
  var-name constants) + `internal/cli/env.go` (parseEnvFlags, envModel/opList
  in-memory env modeling, appendActivate/appendDeactivate, shellQuote,
  strip/prependPathEntry). Wired into dispatcher + usage. Contract details in
  D016 (read it before touching env/hook code). 13 test funcs in env_test.go
  + 4 in routing_test.go; real bash+zsh eval smoke (incl. quote-bearing
  values, PATH strip) passed manually this iteration.
  - Node var choices: NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=.agentmod/node (so npm global bin ==
    node/bin, the one managed PATH entry), NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=node/npm-cache,
    PNPM_HOME=node/pnpm, BUN_INSTALL=node/bun. pnpm/bun global bins are NOT
    on PATH in MVP — list under README limitations (Phase 8).
- `agentmod hook zsh` LANDED and green (T09 ✅, D017): new
  `internal/shellhook` package (`Zsh()` returns the script) +
  `internal/cli/hook.go` (runHook; zsh supported, bash → "not implemented
  yet", others rejected). Wired into dispatcher + usage. Script: pure-zsh
  `_agentmod_find_root` upward walk, `_agentmod_hook` on precmd+chpwd
  (dedup-guarded registration), transitions eval `agentmod env`; failed-root
  cache + A→broken-B fallback deactivate + missing-binary warn-once — full
  contract in D017 (read it AND D016 before touching hook/env code).
  - 9 test funcs in hook_test.go: command table, script-content anchors,
    `zsh -n` syntax gate, cd-in/out (vars+PATH set/restored, HOME untouched,
    OPENCODE_CONFIG set, XDG unset in partial mode), nested nearest-wins,
    precmd new-shell activation (interactive zsh), missing-binary warn-once,
    broken-config error-once + old-project deactivation, double-eval
    single-registration. All run a REAL `zsh -f` (t.Skip if absent) with the
    test binary impersonating agentmod via a TestMain dispatch on
    AGENTMOD_TEST_RUN_MAIN=1 + a /bin/sh wrapper on the child PATH — reuse
    this harness for the bash hook (T10) and integration tests (T11).
  - macOS gotcha (cost one red run): zsh resolves its STARTING dir physically
    (/var→/private/var), so start-inside-project assertions need
    filepath.EvalSymlinks; plain `cd` keeps the logical path.
- `agentmod hook bash` LANDED and green (T10 ✅, D018): `shellhook.Bash()` +
  hook.go bash case wired (usage/error strings now say "zsh, bash").
  bash-3.2-clean script; PROMPT_COMMAND-only registration (no chpwd in
  bash) with `case ";$PC;"` dedup that preserves the user's existing
  PROMPT_COMMAND; same failed-root cache / warn-once / A→broken-B
  deactivate contract as zsh. 7 test funcs in new hook_bash_test.go
  (contents, `bash -n` gate, cd in/out, nested nearest-wins, interactive
  PROMPT_COMMAND new-shell activation, warn-once, broken-config-once,
  eval-twice-registers-once+keeps-user-entry) reusing hook_test.go's
  fakeAgentmodBin/childEnv/lineAfter harness; requireBash prefers
  /bin/bash so macOS tests real 3.2. Non-interactive bash never fires
  PROMPT_COMMAND, so those tests call `_agentmod_hook` explicitly and one
  `-i` run proves the registration path (stderr ignored there: forced-
  interactive bash without tty prints prompts + job-control notice).
  Known limitation for README/doctor: hook inert in non-interactive bash
  scripts (same as direnv).
- rc fenced-block editor LANDED and green (T08 ✅, D019): new
  `internal/cli/rcfile.go` (`ensureShellHook`/`shellHookTarget`/
  `ensureRCBlock`/`rcBlockFor`/`abbrevHome`), wired into runInit after
  ensureGitignore; the `Shell hook:` placeholder line is gone — it now
  reports installed/updated/already-installed in `~/.zshrc` (home
  abbreviated) or a skip reason. Full contract in D019 (read it before
  touching rc code): block = `command -v agentmod … && eval "$(agentmod
  hook <shell>)"` between `# >>> agentmod >>>`/`# <<< agentmod <<<`;
  zsh → ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc; bash → existing .bashrc > existing
  .bash_profile > create .bashrc; SHELL/HOME unset or unsupported shell →
  skip (exit 0); corrupt fence → hard error, zero writes. rc paths derive
  ONLY from injected Env, so tests never go near real rc files.
  10 new test funcs in rcfile_test.go (install/append-glue/idempotent/
  stale-update-in-place/--no-shell-hook-enforcement/skips table/bash rc
  selection ×3/ZDOTDIR/corrupt-fence ×2/zsh+bash -n block syntax).
  init_test.go's TestInitDefaultShellHookLine updated for the new skip
  wording ("not installed yet" placeholder no longer exists).
- `.gitignore` (repo's own): added `.harness/v0/reports/*/*.log` — loop.sh
  logs moved into per-run subdirs (e.g. reports/run1-ratelimited/) were
  not matched by the original one-level pattern and polluted git status.
- `gofmt -l` clean, `go vet` clean, `go test ./...` PASSES (all packages).

## Toolchain baseline (verified on this machine, 2026-06-10)
- go 1.26.2 darwin/arm64 · claude 2.1.170 · codex-cli 0.137.0 · opencode 1.4.3
- jq present (guard hook depends on it, with a fail-safe fallback).

## Global-home baseline (CHECKS.md §2 — compare against this)
Recorded 2026-06-10, all timestamps PREDATE this repo (no writes by us);
re-verified unchanged this iteration:
```
drwxr-xr-x 23 jeongyounglee staff  736  6월  6 10:18:56 2026 ~/.claude
drwxr-xr-x 34 jeongyounglee staff 1088  6월  5 20:51:55 2026 ~/.codex
drwxr-xr-x 10 jeongyounglee staff  320  4월 30 13:53:29 2026 ~/.config/opencode
```
`~/.claude/skills` baseline contains the user's own pre-existing gstack
entries: `gstack`, `gstack-upgrade`, `open-gstack-browser` (D010). These are
NOT a violation; only new entries/mtime changes caused by our work are.

2026-06-10 audit note: `~/.codex` mtime drifted to `6월 10 22:22` — inspected
contents: churn is codex-cli's OWN runtime files from the user's interactive
use (history.jsonl, logs_2.sqlite*, config.toml, shell_snapshots, …); zero
agentmod-named artifacts. Not our work, not a violation. Expect this dir's
mtime to keep moving; audit by looking for agentmod-created entries, not by
mtime equality. `~/.claude` and `~/.config/opencode` unchanged from baseline.

## Failing tests
None. All checks green as of this iteration's end.

## Exact next step
Phase 2: scripted-shell integration tests (T11; TASKS.md Phase 2
"scripted-shell integration tests: activate/deactivate/cross-project,
PATH dedup, HOME untouched"; TEST_MATRIX T11 "env hygiene"). The hook
tests (T09/T10) already cover single transitions per shell; T11 is the
HYGIENE matrix on top:
- Repeated transitions (in→out→in→…, A→B→A cross-project) leave NO
  duplicate PATH entries — assert PATH equals the original after exit
  and contains exactly one `.agentmod/node/bin` entry while inside.
- Pre-existing user values of every routed var (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR,
  CODEX_HOME, OPENCODE_CONFIG, NPM_CONFIG_*, PNPM_HOME, BUN_INSTALL)
  survive a full round-trip: set sentinel values before eval'ing the
  hook, cd through projects, cd out, compare full `env` before/after
  (FABLE_PLAN §7 "perfect inverse — tested by scripted shell sessions
  comparing env before/after").
- HOME never changes at any point; no `AGENTMOD_*` remains after exit;
  no shim files appear anywhere (scan the project + a fake bin dir).
- Run the same matrix in BOTH zsh and bash. Reuse hook_test.go's
  fakeAgentmodBin/childEnv/lineAfter + hook_bash_test.go's runBash
  harness — do NOT invent a new one. Read D016/D017/D018 first.
- Likely shape: a new integration_test.go in internal/cli with a
  table over {zsh, bash} × scenario scripts that dump `env | sort`
  at checkpoints and diff them in Go.

## Cautions for the next iteration
- Guard blocks shell output-redirection (`>>`) to absolute paths under $HOME
  even inside the repo — use the Write/Edit tools for project files instead
  of `cat >>`.
- Do not reinstall mattpocock skills; verify via `skills-lock.json` only.
- `.agentmod/` is gitignored — never commit it.
- Tests must inject fake homes via parameters/env vars consumed by OUR code —
  never reassign the real `HOME` for the parent process, never touch real
  global agent homes (guard blocks it).
- BurntSushi/toml stays the ONLY dependency (D004).
- `config.Load` errors already name the file; don't re-wrap with the path.
- Substring assertions: beware "inactive" CONTAINS "active" — assert on
  "AgentMod: active" style anchored strings (bit us once in status tests).
